    <img src="../img/kfc-chicken.jpg" alt="fried chicken served in a plate">
    <p>The KFC Original Recipe is a secret mix of ingredients that fast food restaurant chain KFC uses to produce fried chicken. </p>
    <p>A copy of the recipe, signed by Sanders, is held safe inside a vault in KFC's Louisville headquarters, along with eleven vials containing the herbs and spices. To maintain the secrecy of the recipe, half of it is produced by Griffith Laboratories before it is given to McCormick, who add the second half.</p>
    <h4 class="recipe">Seasoning Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2⁄3 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1⁄2 teaspoon thyme</li>
        <li>1⁄2 teaspoon basil</li>
        <li>1⁄3 teaspoon oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon celery salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dry mustard</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons paprika</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons white pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups white flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="recipe">Other Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>egg white</li>
        <li>3-4 tablespoons buttermilk</li>
        <li>bread crumbs</li>
        <li>canola oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="recipe">Cooking steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Mix all the seasoning ingredients</p></li>
        <li><p>Pour the egg white to the chicken and the buttermilk. Mix well. Chicken must be moist enough to hold the bread crumbs at the next stage. Pick up each piece of chicken and roll them in the bread crumbs</p></li>
        <li><p>Press down each piece of chicken so the bread crumbs stick to the chicken well. Set aside for at least 10 minutes. A better way is to place on a wired rack</p></li>
        <li><p>Heat oil in a heavy bottom deep pan. Check if the oul is hot enough. Then gently shake off the excess bread crumbs and add the breaded chicken to the hot oil. Fry till golden & crisp at medium high temperature. The oil should be hot enough and the flame at medium high.</p></li>
        <li><p>Once done, remove them to a kitchen towel and leave for 30 seconds. Then immediately move to a wired rack so the remain crisp for longer. If the chicken is not cooked through, you may refry them on medium heat.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your KFC chicken with your favorite dip or ketchup!</p>
